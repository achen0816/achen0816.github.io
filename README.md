## CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging

In spring 2020, I took a class called CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging. This was one of the first upper division CS courses I've taken at UC Berkeley. I didn't know much about computer graphics before taking this class. I was just interested in animation and the intersection of art and technology and was highly curious and wanted to learn more. I loved taking CS 184 and learning about graphics and all its applications. It is definitely one of my favorite courses ever at UC Berkeley. From this class, I've developed a passion for graphics, and it's led me to pursue this interest in multiple different fields, including animation, game development, further classes, and even research.

Check out the projects I've done in this class! All projects were done in Visual Studio 2019 using C++. Each project was pretty challenging, with having to understand the concepts and then translating those ideas into code, but I enjoyed doing each one and the feeling of finally completing a project was very satisfying and rewarding!

## Comfort Zone

In spring 2020, I took the student-run animation course called the UC Berkeley Undergraduate Graphics Group (UCBUGG) Decal. I was always interested in animation, but I don't have too much artistic skill. UCBUGG is a course designed for animation beginners, and the only requirement is a passion for animation and a desire to learn. Throughout the semester, we learned the basics of animation and how to use Maya and Pixar RenderMan and worked in groups of four to create our very own one minute animated film. The film I worked on is called *Comfort Zone*, and it's about a bunny who leaves his comfort zone to discover a new and exciting world of color.

I worked on the scene from 0:39 to 0:44, where a red snake comes into view. I did everything involving the snake, from modeling to shading to rigging. Additionally, I provided the lighting and did all the animating of both the bunny and the snake for this whole scene.
