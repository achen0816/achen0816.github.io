Hello! I'm currently a 3rd year student studying computer science at UC Berkeley! This is a website where I can have some of the projects I've done in one place.

In spring 2020, I took a class called CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging. This was one of the first upper division CS courses I've taken at UC Berkeley.
