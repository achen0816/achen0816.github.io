Hello! I'm currently a 3rd year student studying computer science at UC Berkeley! This is a website where I can have some of the projects I've done in one place.

### CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging

In spring 2020, I took a class called CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging. This was one of the first upper division CS courses I've taken at UC Berkeley. I didn't know much about computer graphics before taking this class. I was just interested in animation and the intersection of art and technology and was highly curious and wanted to learn more. I loved taking CS 184 and learning about graphics and all its applications. It is definitely one of my favorite courses ever at UC Berkeley. From this class, I've developed a passion for graphics, and I'm currently working in a graphics research lab at UC Berkeley to further explore this interest.

Check out the projects I've done in this class! Each project was prety challenging, with having to understand the concepts and then translating those ideas into code, but I enjoyed doing each one and the feeling of finally completing a project was very satisfying and rewarding!
